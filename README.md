# AOC2022
Problem descriptions here: https://adventofcode.com/2022
The goal for this year has been to
- Deepen my knowlegde and know-how of Python
- Learn to write more readable code
- Improve my problem solving skills

Update on 9.12.-22: I think I've reached the end of my capabilities;
The puzzles are starting to take a little too much time from my day
and since I've got studies and work to do as well I need to prioritise.

Until next year.
